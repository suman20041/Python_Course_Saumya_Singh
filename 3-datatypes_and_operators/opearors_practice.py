# Write a program that takes two numbers and prints:
# Their sum, difference and product
# Whether the first number is greater than the second

num1 = 10
num2 = 5
sum = num1 + num2
difference = num1 - num2
product = num1 * num2 
greater = num1 > num2
print("Sum is: ", sum)
print("Difference is: ", difference)
print("Product is: ", product)
print("Greater is: ", greater)
